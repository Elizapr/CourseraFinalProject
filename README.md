# Stock Performance Analysis and Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Web Scraping and Stock Analysis course. The objective is to analyze stock performance using both web scraping techniques and Python libraries, then visualize the data using a dashboard.

## Features
- Extract stock data using the `yfinance` library
- Scrape additional stock information from the web using `BeautifulSoup`
- Analyze historical stock performance
- Build a dashboard to visualize key metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `yfinance` for stock data extraction
- `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- requests for making HTTP requests
- plotly for interactive visualizations
- plotly.graph_objects and plotly.subplots for advanced plotting
- warnings to manage warnings in the script

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Elizapr/CourseraFinalProject.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CourseraFinalProject
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Run the notebook cells in sequence to execute the project.

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Final Assignment.ipynb`).
- Run the notebook to scrape and analyze stock data.
- The generated visualizations will help in understanding stock trends and performance.
